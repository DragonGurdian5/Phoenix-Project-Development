	<entry name="IronWarriors/AircraftDescription" value="Building that produces heldrakes as well as generates loyalty and influence."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/AircraftFlavor" value="10,000 years ago the Heldrakes were fighter craft, piloted by the cream of the Adeptus Astartes. Now, they are hideous amalgams of man and machine, formed by millennia of war into dragon-like creatures that live to fight. This artificial eyrie allows the Warpsmiths to monitor the Heldrakes and even attempt to replicate their age-old creation."/>

	<entry name="IronWarriors/Construction" value="Warp Forge"/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/ConstructionDescription" value="Building that constructs new buildings as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/ConstructionFlavor" value="Though the Warpsmiths’ Soul Forges are deep in the Realm of Chaos and hence inaccessible from Gladius, Chaos is nothing if not flexible. These Warp Forges are kept hot by the daily sacrifice of thousands of civilians, captured in the ruins of their fallen Hive World, to pull the warpbound buildings of Chaos into shimmering existence."/>

	<entry name="IronWarriors/Cult" value="Cultist Camp"/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/CultDescription" value="Building that produces meatshield units, and increases loyalty."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/CultFlavor" value="What are gods without followers? Here, Cultists and Dark Apostles alike plot to bring converts to the worship of Chaos—not a hard task on Gladius, once people see the inhuman Xenos, the undoubted effects of the Dark Gods’ powers, and the Daemonic shapes lingering in the chancel."/>

	<entry name="IronWarriors/Energy" value="Warpbound Generator"/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/EnergyDescription" value="Building that generates energy."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/EnergyFlavor" value="The fallen Techpriests of Chaos—now the Warpsmiths of the Dark Mechanicum—have had ten thousand years of calibrating their devices beyond the strictures of the Omnissiah. As powerful as a conventional Plasma Generator, this power source can be constructed quickly in situ. Its demon spirit draws energy from the flickering of a tear into the Empyrean to charge an infernal motion device."/>

	<entry name="IronWarriors/Headquarters" value="Iron Fortress"/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/HeadquartersDescription" value="Headquarters building that generates resources."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/HeadquartersFlavor" value="Even ten thousand years of heresy hasn’t entirely eliminated a Traitor’s training. Like their fellow Adeptus Astartes, Traitor Marines prefer to operate from a secure, well-constructed defensive position—preferably built by the Iron Warriors. This acts as a forward operations base for their raids and pillaging."/>

	<entry name="IronWarriors/InfantryDescription" value="Building that produces infantry as well as generates food and research."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/InfantryFlavor" value="Not all Chaos Space Marines date from the 30th millenium—others are recruited from civilians, brutally altered with geneseed taken from a fallen Marine. At this genelab, fallen Apothecaries operate on the strongest cultists drawn from Gladius’ ruined Hives. The few who survive the Abominators’ operations are implanted with Progenoid glands and recruited as new Chaos Space Marines."/>

	<entry name="IronWarriors/VehiclesDescription" value="Building that produces ground vehicles as well as generates ore and influence."/>
	<entry name="IronWarriors/VehiclesFlavor" value="Normally confined to the Soul Forges of the Warp, these incomprehensible mechanoid structures are responsible for the creation of all Daemon vehicles. Here, Mechatendril-wreathed Warpsmiths oversee the breaking and corruption of Machine Spirits of captured Imperial vehicles, as well as the forcible incorporation of Lesser Daemons, machinery and tortured flesh into Daemon Engines."/>
